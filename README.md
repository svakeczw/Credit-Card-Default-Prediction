# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is creating a prediction model for credit card default payment by Neural Network. Credit card service is one of the main sectors for banking industry. Loan repayment is the primary income source for most of the bank. If we can predict the payment default rate of each month, banks will have more control on budget and daily operation. The data for this model is from Kaggle website Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset.

## 1. Data preprocessing
* Apply noramalization to scale the feature
* Apply binning & One-Hot encoder to categorical feature
## 2. Model training & prediction
* Use tensorflow to build & train the model, make prediction and evaluate. Also view in google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-dq5LfXWJXcIoWVhxteEBZnlBTRPY8qD?usp=sharing
